Several projects that I did during my time in high school.

1. Forex (and Forex5pm)
  An application to analyze words used in twitter 
  feeds to predict the movement of the exchange rate
  between the Euro and the Dollar. The program applies 
  six tests to two lists of the words most associated 
  with the phrases “EUR/USD” and “USD/EUR” in order to 
  make its daily prediction.

2. RandomCar (and Car)
  An application the breeds random "cars," which are actually
  just 3D shapes, in order to demonstrate how random natural
  selection processes can generate aerodynamic forms from
  random shapes without human design intervention. It saves
  the shapes as 3D files for printing and wind tunnel tests.
