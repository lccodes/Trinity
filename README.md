Several projects that I did during my time in high school.

1. Forex (and Forex5pm)
  An application to analyze words used in twitter 
  feeds to predict the movement of the exchange rate
  between the Euro and the Dollar. The program applies 
  six tests to two lists of the words most associated 
  with the phrases “EUR/USD” and “USD/EUR” in order to 
  make its daily prediction.
